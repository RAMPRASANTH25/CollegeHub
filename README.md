**ABSTRACT**

In a college, staffs and students use multiple applications to compute their work. Currently  there are no platform to achieve collaboration between these apps. Multiple tasks are necessary which reduces work efficiency. So an all-in-one app would make this job easier. CollegeHub is a platform which revolutionizes this into  collegiate experience. It provides easy access to course materials, attendance, results and syllabuses for students, along with a shared calendar for effective time management. Live chat encourages direct communication between students and teachers, and online study groups promote group learning. Students can stay organized and access resources with the help of automated reminders and a large resource library. A customized interface helps teachers manage their classes and communicate with students in real time. The software centralizes on-campus activities and incorporates virtual learning resources for seamless participation. It features special roles for students like class representative. The app redefines college life by boosting connectedness and efficiency for all users with its dual student-teacher approach, easy design, and cross-functional capabilities. We integrate the database stored by the college to this app which helps in modification of data by staffs of their appropriate roles.
